            Education is the backbone of the nation. Education develops humans’
            humanity and turns it into wealth. Life is meaningless without the
            light of education. so we want timely education to enlighten the
            family, society and country and meet the challenges of the 21st
            century. In order to provide up-to-date education, all the
            activities of this institution are being conducted smoothly and
            well-regulated. To this end, in addition to the attendance of
            students, teaching in the classroom, the students of this school are
            regularly snatching success by playing sports, reciting the Quran,
            recitation, debates, cultural events, Victory Day, Independence Day
            parades and displays. In the courtyard of building people there is
            no substitute of craftsman. Enlightened by the light of education,
            this educational institution has been continuously shining since
            1928 with the torch of liberation of the country, nation and world
            humanity. The spontaneous cooperation of respected parents is
            playing a helpful role in the progress of the school. With the
            sincere efforts of all concerned, the progress of the school will
            continue and it will gradually rise to the top of success. I pray to
            the great Lord Almighty.
